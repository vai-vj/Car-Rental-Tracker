# Car-Rental-Tracker (2022-2023)

A Java-based application with a GUI to calculate projected rental profits and test bookings.

## 📖About:
The program will help users determine the best combination of car rental costs and discounts that would be profitable yet reasonable by allowing the user to control different variables that will affect their revenue. The user can test possible outcomes from inputting costs and choosing how much each discount is worth, creating a controlled experiment that can be run multiple times. Additionally, with the use of randomness, the program incorporates uncontrolled factors, such as when the renters book the car, to reflect real-world scenarios. It will also clearly show the loss from discounts with a detailed summary of the costs.  

## ⭐Features:
* Interactive calendar for rental date selection
* Customizable weekday and weekend pricing
* Flexible discount options
